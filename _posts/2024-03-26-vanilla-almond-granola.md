This homemade vanilla almond granola is incredibly easy to make and tastes far better than store-bought versions. Made with just 8 simple ingredients, it's naturally sweetened with maple syrup and features the perfect blend of vanilla and almond flavors. Perfect for breakfast over yogurt or as a healthy snack on the go.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups (213g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats
- 3/4 cup (100g) sliced almonds
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (120ml) pure maple syrup
- 1/4 cup (56g) coconut oil, melted
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).

2. In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients:
   - Oats
   - Sliced almonds
   - Cinnamon
   - Salt

3. In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients:
   - Maple syrup
   - Melted coconut oil
   - Almond extract
   - Vanilla extract

4. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and mix until everything is well coated.

5. Spread the mixture evenly on a large baking sheet.

6. Bake for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to ensure even browning.

7. Let the granola cool completely on the baking sheet - this is where it gets its crunch!

## Recipe Notes

- Makes approximately 2.5-3 cups
- Storage: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks
- Substitutions:
  - Coconut oil can be replaced with vegetable oil or melted butter
  - Feel free to add dried fruits after baking
- For extra clusters, press the granola down firmly on the baking sheet before baking

## Tips for Success

- Use old-fashioned whole rolled oats, not quick oats
- Don't skip the stirring every 15 minutes - this ensures even browning
- Let cool completely before storing to maintain crunchiness
- Don't stack the granola while cooling - this helps maintain crispiness
