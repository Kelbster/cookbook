Learn how to make incredibly smooth, creamy, and delicious homemade hummus! This recipe uses a special technique of cooking canned chickpeas with baking soda to achieve that perfect restaurant-style texture. No more grainy or gritty hummus - this recipe delivers the silky smooth results you've been looking for.

## Ingredients

- 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- ½ teaspoon baking soda (for cooking chickpeas)
- ½ cup tahini
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (from 1½ to 2 lemons)
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 2-3 tablespoons ice water
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- Optional garnishes: drizzle of olive oil, sprinkle of ground sumac or paprika, chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the chickpeas**: Place 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas and ½ teaspoon baking soda in a medium saucepan. Cover with several inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue boiling for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas are very tender and falling apart. Drain the chickpeas and rinse under cool running water.

2. **Process the garlic and lemon**: In a food processor or high-powered blender, combine ¼ cup fresh lemon juice and 2 minced garlic cloves. Let the mixture rest for 10 minutes to allow the garlic to mellow.

3. **Make the tahini mixture**: Add ½ cup tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary.

4. **Add ice water**: While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water. Stop and scrape down the sides, then blend until the mixture is ultra smooth and creamy.

5. **Add remaining ingredients**: Add ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon ground cumin, and the prepared chickpeas to the food processor. While blending, drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, about 2 minutes.

6. **Adjust consistency**: If your hummus is thicker than you'd like, blend in additional ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (up to 1 additional tablespoon), until you reach your desired consistency.

7. **Adjust seasoning**: Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt, cumin, or lemon juice if needed.

8. **Serve**: Transfer the hummus to a serving bowl. Top with a drizzle of olive oil and your choice of garnishes (sumac, paprika, or fresh parsley). Serve with pita bread, pita chips, or fresh vegetables.

## Recipe Notes

- **Storage**: Homemade hummus will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week.
- **Make it ahead**: You can make this hummus in advance. It actually gets better after a day in the refrigerator.
- **Tahini tip**: Use good-quality tahini for the best results. Recommended brands include Soom and Trader Joe's organic tahini.
- **Freezing**: Hummus can be frozen in an airtight container for 4-6 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and stir well before serving.
