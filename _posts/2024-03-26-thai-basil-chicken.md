### Important Tips

- Always have your rice cooked before starting the stir-fry
- Try to find Thai holy basil (กะเพรา / kra pao) for authentic flavor
- Don't overcook the basil - it only needs about 5 seconds of heat
- The fried egg should have crispy edges but a runny yolk
- Feel free to adjust the number of chilies to your spice preference

### Substitutions

- Chicken can be replaced with pork, beef, or tofu
- If you absolutely cannot find holy basil, Thai sweet basil can be used but will give a different flavor
- Dark soy sauce can be replaced with Indonesian kecap manis
