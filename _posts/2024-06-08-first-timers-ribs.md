This recipe from Steven Raichlen's Barbecue! Bible is the perfect introduction to making mouthwatering, competition-quality ribs at home. You'll learn how to prep, rub, mop, and glaze your ribs for maximum flavor and tenderness. Great for beginners and seasoned grillers alike!

## Ingredients

### For the mop sauce:
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup apple cider
- 3 tablespoons bourbon, or 3 more tablespoons apple cider
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce

### For the rub and ribs:
- 2 tablespoons coarse salt (kosher or sea)
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons sweet paprika
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons dry mustard (preferably Colman's)
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon celery seed
- 2 racks baby back pork ribs (4 to 5 pounds total)
- Lemon Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce or another favorite barbecue sauce

## Instructions

1. **Make the mop sauce:** Melt the butter in a nonreactive saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the cider, bourbon, and soy sauce. Keep warm until ready to use.

2. **Make the rub:** In a small bowl, mix the salt, brown sugar, paprika, pepper, mustard, garlic powder, and celery seed with your fingers, breaking up any lumps.

3. **Prepare the ribs:** Place a rack of ribs meat side down on a baking sheet. Remove the thin, papery membrane from the back of the rack by inserting a slender implement (like a butter knife) under it. Use a paper towel or pliers to grip and peel off the membrane. Repeat with the second rack.

4. Set aside 1 tablespoon of rub for serving. Sprinkle the remaining rub over both sides of the ribs, rubbing it into the meat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you set up the grill.

5. **Set up the grill:** Prepare for indirect grilling and preheat to medium (325° to 350°F). Place a large drip pan in the center of the grill.

6. **Cook the ribs:** Brush and oil the grill grate. Place the ribs, bone side down, in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. (If space is tight, stand the racks upright in a rib rack.) If using a charcoal grill, toss half the wood chips on each mound of coals. Cover and cook for 45 minutes.

7. **Mop the ribs** on both sides with the mop sauce. Re-cover and continue cooking until well browned, cooked through, and tender enough to pull apart with your fingers, 45 minutes to 1 hour longer (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours total). Mop every 15 minutes and replenish coals as needed.

8. **Just before serving**, brush the ribs on both sides with barbecue sauce and move them directly over the fire. Grill until the sauce is browned and bubbling, 1 to 3 minutes per side.

9. **Transfer** to a platter or cutting board. Let rest a few minutes, then cut into portions. Serve with extra barbecue sauce and reserved rub on the side.

## Recipe Notes

- **Smoker method:** Smoke ribs at 250°F for 4–5 hours, mopping after 1 hour and then every hour. Brush with barbecue sauce 30 minutes before done. Replenish wood and coals as needed.
- **Yield:** Serves 4-6
