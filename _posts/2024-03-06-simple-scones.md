A perfect recipe for delicious tender scones with juicy raisins. This sweet scone recipe is easy to make with simple baking ingredients, butter, and sour cream. Perfect for a holiday breakfast, brunch, or afternoon treat with a cup of tea!

## Preparation Time
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes
- Additional Time: 5 minutes
- Total Time: 35 minutes
- Servings: 8 scones

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen
- ½ cup raisins or dried currants
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon white sugar (for topping)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, mix together:
   - flour
   - 1/3 cup sugar
   - baking powder
   - salt
   - baking soda

3. Grate the frozen butter into the flour mixture using the large holes of a box grater. Use your fingers to work in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

4. Add the raisins to the flour-butter mixture.

5. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and egg until well combined.

6. Using a fork, stir the sour cream mixture into the flour mixture until large dough clumps form. Use your hands to shape the dough into a ball. (Note: The dough may seem dry at first but will come together as you work it.)

7. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7 to 8-inch circle, about 3/4-inch thick.

8. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar.

9. Using a sharp knife, cut the circle into 8 equal triangles and place them on the prepared baking tray, about 1-inch apart.

10. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until golden brown.

11. Cool for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.
