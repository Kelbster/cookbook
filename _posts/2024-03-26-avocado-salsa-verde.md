   - Add roasted tomatillos to a blender or food processor
   - Add 1/2 onion, garlic clove, cilantro, and 1/2 of the jalapeño
   - Pulse blend until combined
   - Taste for heat level and add more jalapeño if desired

   - Season with salt to taste

## Recipe Notes

### Tips for Success

- Start with half the jalapeño and adjust the heat level to your preference
- If using canned tomatillos, skip the roasting step
- For the cilantro, you can include the upper stems - just remove the thicker bottom portions
- Serve immediately for best results
- Some people like to add a splash of lime juice for extra brightness
- Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1-2 days
