These light and crispy waffles are a breakfast dream come true. The recipe uses a clever combination of cornstarch and beaten egg whites to achieve the perfect texture - crispy on the outside while remaining light and fluffy on the inside. Recipe adapted from Pam Anderson's CookSmart cookbook.

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 cup buttermilk
- 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 1 large egg, separated
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Pure maple syrup, for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°F (for keeping waffles warm).

2. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.

3. In a glass measuring cup, blend the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and milk. Beat in the egg yolk.

4. In a separate medium bowl, beat the egg white to soft peaks.

5. Gradually add the sugar to the egg whites and beat until firm and glossy. Beat in the vanilla.

6. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until just blended.

7. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the beaten egg white until just incorporated.

8. Preheat an 8-inch square waffle iron and oil it lightly.

9. Pour about 1 1/2 cups of the waffle batter into the preheated waffle iron and gently smooth the surface with a spatula.

10. Bake for 4 minutes, or until browned and crisp.

11. Transfer the waffles to the oven to keep warm and repeat with the remaining batter.

12. Serve immediately with maple syrup.

## Recipe Notes

- Yield: Makes 7 (3 3/4-inch-square) waffles
- Total Time: 35 minutes
- Active Time: 20 minutes

### Tips for Success

- Don't stack the finished waffles - they'll become moist and limp. Instead, place them directly on the oven rack at 200°F to keep warm and crispy.
- The recipe can be doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled.
- If your waffle maker is a different size, follow the manufacturer's instructions for batter amount.
- The cornstarch helps create the crispy exterior by inhibiting gluten formation.
- Be careful not to overmix when folding in the egg whites to maintain their airiness.
