Ackee and Saltfish is Jamaica's beloved national dish. This breakfast staple combines the delicate, creamy texture of ackee with flaky salted cod, all sautéed with aromatic vegetables and spices. The result is a hearty, flavorful dish that's perfect served alongside traditional sides like boiled green bananas, yam, or hard dough bread.

## Ingredients

- 1 can ackee (about 2 cups) or 2 cups fresh ackee
- ⅓ lb boneless/skinless saltfish (salted cod)
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 1 habanero or scotch bonnet pepper
- 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 medium tomato, cubed
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 scallions, chopped
- ¼ medium sweet bell pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

### Preparing the Saltfish

1. Place the saltfish in a pot of water and bring to a boil
2. Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes to remove excess salt
3. Drain, rinse under cool water, and squeeze dry
4. Break the fish into large flakes and set aside

### Preparing the Dish

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat

2. Add garlic, sliced onions, and scotch bonnet pepper
   - Cook for 2-3 minutes until onions begin to soften

3. Add the sweet pepper, scallions, black pepper, and thyme
   - Cook for another 2 minutes

4. Add the flaked saltfish
   - Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally

5. Add the cubed tomato
   - Cook for 1-2 minutes until just warmed through

6. Add the ackee:
   - If using canned ackee, drain and rinse gently with cold water
   - Add to the pan carefully to avoid breaking
   - Use two forks to gently toss with other ingredients
   - Heat through for 1-2 minutes until warmed

## Notes

- When using canned ackee, handle it very gently as it breaks apart easily
- No additional salt is needed as the saltfish provides enough saltiness
- For less heat, remove the seeds and membrane from the scotch bonnet pepper
- If using fresh ackee, ensure it is fully ripe and properly prepared, as unripe ackee can be toxic
- The dish can be served with boiled green bananas, yam, dumplings, or hard dough bread
- You can soak the saltfish overnight in cold water instead of boiling, if preferred
