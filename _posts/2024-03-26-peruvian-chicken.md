This Peruvian-style roast chicken (Pollo a la Brasa) features a flavorful marinade of lime juice, garlic, and spices that creates perfectly seasoned, juicy meat with crispy skin. The accompanying green sauce is creamy, zesty, and adds the perfect kick to complement the chicken.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup lime juice (from 2 limes)
- 4 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 4 pound whole chicken

### For the Green Sauce
- 3 jalapeño peppers, roughly chopped (seeded for less heat if desired)
- 1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves
- 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

### For the Chicken

1. In a blender or food processor, combine olive oil, lime juice, garlic, salt, paprika, black pepper, cumin, oregano, and sugar. Blend until smooth.

2. Prepare the chicken:
   - Remove giblets and pat the chicken dry with paper towels
   - Using your fingers or a wooden spoon handle, carefully loosen the skin over the breasts and legs
   - Spoon about ⅔ of the marinade under the skin
   - Rub the remaining marinade over the skin
   - Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight

3. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a roasting pan with foil and place a rack inside.

4. Place the marinated chicken on the rack and tie the legs together with kitchen string.

5. Roast for 20 minutes until skin is golden.

6. Reduce heat to 375°F (190°C) and continue roasting for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until juices run clear when cut between leg and thigh.

7. Tent with foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.

### For the Green Sauce

1. In a blender or food processor, combine:
   - Jalapeños
   - Cilantro
   - Garlic
   - Mayonnaise
   - Sour cream
   - Lime juice
   - Salt
   - Black pepper

2. Blend until smooth.

3. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until well combined.

4. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

## Notes

- The heat level of the green sauce can be adjusted by including more or fewer jalapeño seeds and ribs.
- The green sauce will seem thin at first but will thicken as it sits in the refrigerator.
- For food safety, wash hands thoroughly after handling jalapeños and avoid touching your eyes.
- If the chicken browns too quickly during roasting, cover loosely with foil.
