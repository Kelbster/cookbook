Served on a toasted brioche bun with cooling coleslaw and tangy pickles.

## Recipe Notes

### Tips for Success
- Season the flour well for the best flavor
- Create flour crumbles for extra crunch
- Fry immediately after breading
- Keep chicken warm in oven between batches
- Baste with hot sauce while chicken is still hot
- Don't skip the brown sugar in the hot sauce

### Substitutions
- Buttermilk can be replaced with plain yogurt thinned with water
- Any vinegar-based hot sauce works
- Adjust cayenne to control heat level

### Storage
Best served fresh and hot. If needed, store leftover chicken separate from toppings in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat in oven to maintain crispiness.
